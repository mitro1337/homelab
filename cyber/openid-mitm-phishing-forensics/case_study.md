# Case Study: Forensic Analysis of an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) Attack on Steam OpenID Authentication

**Author:** @stefanutc1 
**Date:** 22 November 2025 
**Classification:** TLP:CLEAR / Technical Cyber Threat Intelligence 
**Target Analyzed:** Active phishing and account takeover campaign leveraging Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) fake popups and real-time OpenID session relay.

## 1. Executive Summary

This case study documents an in-depth forensic investigation into an advanced **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)** phishing campaign targeting the competitive gaming ecosystem (CS2, Dota 2). Threat actors engineered deceptive tournament voting portals that lured victims into authenticating via a fraudulent Steam OpenID login mechanism.

The malicious infrastructure weaponized a high-fidelity **Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM)** popup interface to intercept OpenID 2.0 authentication handshakes in real time. Upon capturing valid Steam Guard TOTP codes and session cookies (`steamLoginSecure`, `sessionid`), the adversary automatically enabled a **Family View PIN lockout** to prevent the victim from altering account settings, while provisioning Steam Web API keys to intercept and reroute digital inventory trade offers.

 actor Victim as Victim User
 participant FakeSite as Phishing Landing Page (Fake Tournament)
 participant AttackerProxy as AiTM Reverse Proxy C2
 participant SteamAuth as Valve Steam OpenID (steamcommunity.com)
 actor AttackerBot as Automated Trade Hijack Bot

 Victim->>FakeSite: 1. Clicks tournament link & selects "Vote via Steam"
 FakeSite->>Victim: 2. Renders fake popup window with simulated SSL address bar
 Victim->>FakeSite: 3. Inputs Steam username, password & Steam Guard TOTP
 FakeSite->>AttackerProxy: 4. Transmits credentials via JSON POST in real-time
 AttackerProxy->>SteamAuth: 5. Executes legitimate OpenID login handshake
 SteamAuth-->>AttackerProxy: 6. Issues authenticated session cookies (steamLoginSecure)
 AttackerProxy->>AttackerBot: 7. Transfers session context to trading bot
 AttackerBot->>SteamAuth: 8. Configures Family View PIN (locks victim settings)
 AttackerBot->>SteamAuth: 9. Generates Web API Key & intercepts trade offers
 AttackerProxy-->>FakeSite: 10. Displays error message ("Vote recorded / Server busy")
```

### 2.1 Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) Mechanics

Unlike traditional phishing campaigns that redirect victims to an external typo-squatted URL, the attacker utilized a simulated in-page window (`<div>` container) equipped with draggable title bars, an address bar mimicking `https://steamcommunity.com/openid/login`, and an interactive SSL padlock icon.

### 2.2 Session Relay & Cookie Extraction

1. Frontend JavaScript (`main.bundle.js`) intercepted the login form submit event.
2. Credentials and mobile authenticator codes were dispatched via `fetch()` to `/api/v2/auth/steam_callback`.
3. The C2 reverse proxy immediately initiated an automated session with Valve's authentication servers, acquiring the `steamLoginSecure` authentication token.

## 3. Post-Exploitation & Account Takeover Chain

1. **Family View Lockout**: The attacker automatically assigned a 4-digit PIN to Steam Family View, restricting the victim from accessing profile security settings, changing their email address, or revoking active sessions.
2. **API Key Generation**: A Steam Web API Key was provisioned, granting the adversary read access to incoming and outgoing trade proposals.
3. **Trade Offer Hijacking**: When the victim initiated legitimate trade offers with friends or third-party marketplaces, the attacker's bot instantly canceled the original offer and created an identical offer to an impostor account.

## 4. Technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Category | Indicator / Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phishing Domains** | `cs2-tournament-bracket[.]top`, `vote-league-cup[.]com` | Ingress landing portals hosting the BitM kit. |
| **Hosting ASN** | `AS202425` (Offshore Disposable VPS) | Infrastructure ignoring abuse and DMCA notices. |
| **SSL Certificates** | Let's Encrypt R3 (issued $<24$h prior to campaign launch) | Domain-validated certificates providing HTTPS padlock. |
| **Targeted Cookies** | `steamLoginSecure`, `sessionid`, `steamMachineAuth*` | Core authentication and transaction tokens. |
| **API Endpoints** | `/api/v2/auth/steam_callback`, `/api/v2/stream/event` | C2 backend endpoints for harvesting telemetry. |

## 5. MITRE ATT&CK Matrix Mapping

| Phase | Tactic | Technique ID | Technique Name & Operational Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Access** | Initial Access | `T1566.002` | **Phishing: Spearphishing Link** (Discord tournament lures). |
| **Execution** | Execution | `T1204.001` | **User Execution: Malicious Link** (victim opens fake voting portal). |
| **Credential Access** | Credential Access | `T1557.001` | **AiTM: Browser-in-the-Middle Relay** (harvesting OpenID cookies). |
| **Persistence** | Persistence | `T1098` | **Account Manipulation** (enabling Family View PIN lockout & API key). |
| **Exfiltration** | Exfiltration | `T1048` | **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** (exfiltrating session cookies to bot). |
| **Impact** | Impact | `T1496` | **Resource Hijacking / Inventory Theft** (unauthorized asset transfer). |

## 6. Defensive Countermeasures & Incident Response

1. **User Verification**: Authentic Steam OpenID sign-in prompts will immediately recognize an active browser session on `steamcommunity.com` and require only a single click ("Sign In"), never asking for a password or TOTP re-entry.
2. **API Key Auditing**: Inspect `https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey` regularly for unauthorized API registrations.
3. **Enterprise Defense**: Deploy DNS sinkholing for newly registered domains (NRDs) matching gaming and tournament keywords.
