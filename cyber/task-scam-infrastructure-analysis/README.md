## 1. Project Overview

</div>

This repository documents the forensic reverse engineering, backend API inspection, SQL injection surface analysis, and financial entrapment mechanics of a global **Task Scam / Pig Butchering platform**.

Organized fraud syndicates recruit victims through unsolicited WhatsApp, Telegram, and TikTok messages under the guise of flexible remote work ("optimizing e-commerce merchant ratings" or "app store reviews"). Victims are lured into registering on deceptive web applications using mandatory operator invitation codes (`888888`). While initial micro-tasks simulate rapid profit accumulation, attempting to withdraw funds reveals a hardcoded architectural lock requiring escalating **USDT (TRC-20) cryptocurrency deposits** that are permanently expropriated.

## 3. Deep-Dive Technical Findings

</div>

<div align="center">

### 3.1 Unauthenticated Configuration Disclosure (`/api/v1/site/config`)

</div>
Interrogating the unauthenticated backend configuration endpoint disclosed the underlying operational rules of the scam infrastructure:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "siteName": "Global E-Commerce Task Hub",
    "defaultCountryCode": "+40",
    "withdrawMethodBank": false,
    "withdrawMethodRevolut": false,
    "minDepositUSDT": 50,
    "aiNewsFeed": [
      {
        "title": "Platform partners with top retailers",
        "date": "2026-08-01"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **The Withdrawal Kill-Switch**: The backend explicitly sets `withdrawMethodBank: false` and `withdrawMethodRevolut: false`. Although the client UI displays sleek buttons for SEPA bank and Revolut cashouts, the backend rejects any non-crypto disbursement, trapping user funds.
- **Regional Targeting**: The `defaultCountryCode` parameter enforced `+40`, confirming deliberate targeting of the Romanian domestic market.
- **Fabricated Authority Feed**: The "AI NEWS" section is driven by static, hardcoded JSON objects with fabricated partner press releases designed to simulate corporate credibility.

<div align="center">

### 3.2 SQL Injection (SQLi) Surface (`SQLI.md`)

</div>
- **Vulnerable Entry Points**: The `invite_code` parameter (validated as `888888` or `VIP999`) and the `username` parameter in `POST /api/v1/user/auth/login` exhibited clear signs of unparameterized string concatenation.
- **Time-Based Inference**: Injecting quote delimiters and sleep primitives produced measurable latency spikes in API responses, indicating unescaped query execution against campaign authentication tables.

<div align="center">

### 3.3 Hardware Fingerprinting & Anti-Analysis (`fingerprinting.md`)

</div>
The web client executes aggressive fingerprinting stored in browser `localStorage`:
- **Canvas / WebGL Fingerprinting**: Renders invisible 2D/3D geometries to compute a unique hardware hash of the client's GPU (identifying the analysis environment's GTX 1050 Ti).
- **Hardware Architecture**: Queries `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (2 cores in test sandbox) and OS architecture (`x86_64`).
- **Device Tracking UUIDs**: Persists `device_id` and `device_send` tokens across sessions to detect security researchers or multi-account bot probes.

<div align="center">

### 3.4 White-Label Localization Leaks (`ui_manipulation.md`)

</div>
- Directly altering the `lang` key in browser `localStorage` to `ru` instantly translated the entire interface into Russian (`Регистрация`, `Авторизация`).
- Despite forcing Russian strings, the regional dialing prefix remained locked to `+40`, conclusively demonstrating that the platform is a commercial off-the-shelf white-label scam kit deployed by Russian-speaking developers and purchased by regional affiliate operators.

## 7. Practical Security Guidelines: DOs and DON'Ts

</div>

<div align="center">

### WHAT TO DO (DOs) - Protective Actions

</div>

| Recommended Action | Detailed Instructions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Recognize the Task Scam pattern immediately** | Any "job" that pays you to tap buttons, like products, rate videos, or "optimize algorithms" is 100% a fraudulent Ponzi / Pig Butchering trap. |
| **2. Cease all cryptocurrency deposits** | If a platform demands you deposit USDT, Bitcoin, or fiat to "unlock higher tasks", "pay tax", or "unfreeze your account", **stop immediately**. Depositing more will NEVER release previous funds. |
| **3. Block and report recruiters** | Report the WhatsApp or Telegram profiles to the platform's anti-spam desk and block the numbers immediately. |
| **4. Trace blockchain transactions on TRONSCAN** | Export the attacker's TRC-20 deposit address and transaction hashes (`txid`). Check on TRONSCAN / Etherscan to identify exchange deposit clusters (Binance, OKX, Bybit). |
| **5. File complaints with Exchange Compliance Desks** | If transaction hops reveal funds entering centralized exchanges, immediately submit an emergency fraud report with law enforcement case references to freeze the destination accounts. |

<div align="center">

### WHAT NOT TO DO (DON'Ts) - Critical Traps to Avoid

</div>

| Critical Trap | Threat Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO NOT pay "taxes", "security deposits", or "audit fees"** | Scammers will claim your balance is "under review" and require a 30% fee to release it. This is a secondary extortion attempt. |
| **DO NOT trust "recovery agents" on social media** | Anyone contacting you on Telegram, Instagram, or Reddit claiming they can "hack into the blockchain" or "recover your lost USDT" is a secondary recovery scammer. Blockchain transactions cannot be reversed by third parties. |
| **DO NOT believe initial micro-withdrawals** | Fraudsters intentionally allow a tiny initial withdrawal (e.g. $10 - $20) to build false trust and convince victims to deposit thousands later. |
| **DO NOT provide personal identification (KYC) documents** | Do not upload ID cards, passports, or driver's licenses to task scam sites. They will be harvested and used to open fraudulent bank accounts or register new scam domains. |
