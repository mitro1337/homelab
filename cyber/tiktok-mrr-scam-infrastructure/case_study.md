## 1. Threat Narrative & Incident Context

Between June 2025 and April 2026, an extensive forensic evaluation was conducted into automated "faceless" digital marketing funnels operating across social media platforms, with a primary focus on TikTok algorithmic feeds targeting users in Romania, Eastern Europe, and the Balkan region.

On June 14, 2025, a real-world incident was documented involving an acquaintance who was persuaded by targeted TikTok short-form video hooks to purchase a $497 "Digital Wealth & Marketing Accelerator" course hosted on a `stan.store` merchant landing page.

Upon post-purchase technical extraction, the delivered package was revealed to contain:
1. Low-grade, generic e-books generated verbatim via automated Large Language Model (LLM) prompts (ChatGPT-3.5/4), devoid of original research, case studies, or operational business guidance.
2. A "Master Resell Rights" (MRR) licensing contract that explicitly instructs the buyer that the quickest way to monetize the course is to configure their own clone Stan.store funnel and resell the exact same bundle to other users for 100% profit.

This model constitutes a classic recursive pyramid scheme disguised as digital education.

## 2. Formal Abuse Escalation & Communications

Prior to public research archiving, formal abuse notifications were transmitted to the hosting platform's Trust & Safety infrastructure, the underlying payment acquirers, and consumer protection bodies.

Subject: Formal Notice of Deceptive Practices & Recursive Financial Scheme Hosting (Violation of ToS)

I am writing to report a widespread violation of your Terms of Service regarding "Deceptive Practices."
A significant number of stores on your platform are promoting Master Resell Rights (MRR). These are not legitimate educational products; they are structured as recursive financial schemes where the only "value" sold is the right to resell the same "value" to others.
As a security researcher and student, I have documented how these stores target vulnerable demographics in Romania and another balkan countries. By providing the infrastructure (payment processing and hosting) for these pyramid-style schemes, Stan.store is facilitating financial harm.
Failure to act will result in a formal report to Stripe's Integrity Team and the FTC regarding the facilitation of "get-rich-quick" schemes through your platform.

### Forensic Analysis of Delivered LLM Artifacts

Extracted PDF metadata and lexical analysis demonstrated that over 94% of the textual content was generated using basic prompt chaining:
* Default LLM transition markers: *"In conclusion, it is important to remember..."*, *"In today's fast-paced digital world..."*.
* Zero verifiable citations, code repositories, ad campaign telemetry, or measurable marketing strategies.
* Synthesized graphic covers generated via mid-tier Canva templates with stock photography.

## 4. Payment Gateway & Merchant Platform Exploitation

1. **Stripe Connect Sub-Merchant Abuse**: Funnel platforms utilize Stripe Connect onboarding. Because the parent platform acts as the platform provider, individual storefront operators frequently bypass standard underwriting checks and high-risk merchant categorization for digital goods.
2. **Dispute Evasion Tactics**: Storefronts enforce aggressive "No Refund" policies buried in footer terms, falsely claiming that "instant digital file delivery waives all statutory cooling-off rights under consumer protection laws."
3. **Multi-Platform Failover**: When accounts are suspended on one payment gateway, operators rapidly switch their Stan.store backend to alternative processors (PayPal, Whop, or crypto checkout widgets).

## 5. Comprehensive Defensive & Prevention Guide: How to Avoid and Combat Digital Marketing Scams

To protect users, students, and family members from predatory Master Resell Rights and automated LLM digital product funnels, the following technical and operational heuristics must be applied:

### A. Immediate Red Flags (Triage Checklist)

1. **Recursive Product Value ("Sell the Rights to Sell")**:
   If the primary value proposition of an online course or guide is that you get 100% rights to resell the course itself, it is by definition a pyramid-style scheme. Legitimate courses teach specialized technical skills (software development, data analysis, certified cloud security) where value exists independently of reselling the material.
2. **Fabricated Income Dashboards**:
   Viral TikTok videos displaying screenshots of six-figure Stripe or PayPal daily revenues are universally spoofed using basic browser developer tools (`F12 Inspect Element` on web dashboards) or test-mode Stripe accounts.
3. **"Faceless / Done-For-You" Marketing Promises**:
   Claims that complete beginners can generate thousands of dollars per month on autopilot using AI-generated faceless videos and pre-made templates are fraudulent.
4. **Vague, Buzzword-Heavy Syllabi**:
   Content outlines that promise "Financial Freedom", "Mindset Mastery", and "Digital Growth Secrets" without providing verifiable curriculum details, instructor credentials, or actionable frameworks.

### B. Technical Verification & Due Diligence

* **Reverse Image & Text Search**: Copy paragraphs from preview pages or promotional materials into search engines or AI detection tools. Over 90% of MRR materials are identical copies of public domain prompt dumps.
* **Inspect the Hosting & Merchant Chain**: Identify if the vendor operates on an ephemeral single-page checkout (`*.stan.store`, `*.beacons.ai`) without an established company domain, registered fiscal code (CIF/CUI), or physical corporate address.

### C. Remediation & Chargeback Protocol

If a transaction has already occurred:
1. **Initiate a Bank Chargeback**: Contact your card-issuing bank immediately. Request a chargeback under **Reason Code 4853 (Mastercard: Goods/Services Not Provided or Defective/Not as Described)** or **Visa Condition 13.3 (Not as Described / Deceptive Practices)**. Provide evidence that the content was misrepresented as a genuine training course but constitutes an illicit multi-level resale scheme.
2. **File PayPal Disputes**: Open a dispute under "Significantly Not As Described" and upload screenshots showing the lack of genuine educational content and the recursive resale requirement.
3. **Escalate to Regulatory Bodies**: File formal consumer complaints with national consumer protection agencies (ANPC in Romania, FTC in the United States, or the European Consumer Centre Network ECC-Net).

## 6. Regulatory & Legal Frameworks

* **United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC Act Section 5, 15 U.S.C. § 45)**: Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, specifically targeting get-rich-quick and deceptive multi-level marketing structures.
* **European Union Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices)**: Annex I, Item 14 explicitly bans *"Establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme where a consumer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products."*
* **ISO/IEC 27037:2012 Compliance**: All extracted transaction records, video captures, and email headers in this case study were cryptographically preserved and timestamped for evidentiary integrity.
